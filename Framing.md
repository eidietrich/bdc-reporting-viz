Two things I'm trying to get at here: 1) How much value

I've done that by 

## Analysis
(Do this as )
### VOLUME + VALUE

First, note the volume here — 561 stories, or slightly more than one piece a workday on average. And I wasn't by any means the paper's most prolific writer during this period either, a distinction that would probably go to either veteran education reporter Gail Schontzler ::LINK or police and courts reporter Whitney Bermes ::LINK.

Beat reporters at daily newspapers capture a huge amount of basic information about our society — the vast majority of it reliable if sometimes boring writing, the sort of thing we typically take for granted. ::MORE HERE 

### CONNECTING THE DOTS

Newspaper-style writing has traditionally relied on the assumption that most of its audience is daily readers, people in the habit of browsing each day's paper over their morning coffee.

As such, traditional, just-the-facts newspaper articles tend to take an incremental approach to issues, leading with new developments like a commission vote or a fresh filing in a court case. That assumes readers know the back story to the issues being covered — but can be baffling to occasional readers when they encounter a topic for the first-time.

Take this headline of mine for instance — ::BLACK OLIVE EXAMPLE HERE. If know Black-Olive is a contentious development proposal seen as a bellwether for the city's  direction, it makes sense that ::WHATEVER is worth a headline in the local paper. If you don't, the paper's decision to feature it feels a bit puzzling.

Furthermore, the way modern web publishing works means its less and less likely any particular reader, even an attentive one, sees every story a news outlet puts out about a particular issue. Instead of plowing through a daily paper, online readers tend to see occasional articles from a wide variety of outlets as they browse sites like Facebook. Big stories — or outrage-inducing ones — tend to find their way to sizable audiences. But there's a good chance you never see the sober follow-up pieces. 

That means local papers like the Chronicle are having a harder and harder time showing anyone but their most engaged readers full story arcs. Much of the nuance in my Black-Olive coverage, for example, came out over time <LINKS: Story on neighbors worried about parking, profile of the developer behind the project, plus the obligatory meeting coverage >. If you caught one or two pieces over the course of the issue (say the ones your irate Facebook friend shared because they found them upsetting), you're missing much of the story.

::POINT TO MAKE: MUCH OF THE KNOWLEDGE HERE IS IN CONNECTIONS BETWEEN STORIES

### RETHINKING DIGITAL NEWS

The [Chronicle's home page](https://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/), like the website for nearly every newspaper in the country, is focused on presenting visitors with the news of the day — the same material, more or less, that you get buying a physical paper off the news stand. The same goes for its social media channels — with #throwbackthursday exceptions, the stuff it shares to Facebook or Twitter is freshly written.

The Chronicle website does give access to older stories — decades of them — but you can really only get to them by running a search, either through Google or the somewhat clunky on-site interface. As I see it, that's a missed opportunity.

Put another way, newspaper websites are almost universally tailored to the 'What's new today?' use case. Which is fine for in-the-know residents wanting to keep up with what's going on in their town. But it isn't really optimal for less-engaged readers who might be more interested in the background on a current issue than the latest update, or new arrivals looking for a primer on elected officials or ongoing civic debates.

To some extent reporters and editors can address that in the way they write and structure articles (using Sunday features like my 'How will we grow?' series on Bozeman's growth <LINK> to add context beyond daily stories, for instance). But there's also a more fundamental user experience issue for media outlets to consider — how to present archival material in ways that make it easier for readers to see the pattern of their community's recent history.

The interactive above, based on data pulled from a Chronicle RSS feed, is a stab in that direction. ::MORE





# LEAD-IN New:

It's hard to see how just how much work local news produces, given how news tends to come to readers piecemeal these days, through the web. But this is what we're in danger losing.

# Two years of tracking Bozeman's growth

At 27 years old, I'm young to have a job that's part of a dying breed —- a beat reporter for a small local newspaper, specifically Bozeman, Montana's [Daily Chronicle](http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/).

[Describe job, how long I've been doing it for]

Newsrooms like mine are smaller, less experienced and more poorly compensated than we once were. 

Still, our work still matters.

I'm quite often the only professional in the room as Bozeman's city commission . 

A couple times now, I've had the terrifying experience of interviewing candidates for public office, only to realize that the vast majority of what they know about the relevant issues comes from stories I've written.

Beyond that sort of anecdote, though, what sort of impact
